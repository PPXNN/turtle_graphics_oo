# OO code using turtle graphics
- From the starting code, polygon_art.py, you are to write an OO program that generates different pieces of art works
- Fork, then, clone this repo
- Read the instructions given in the course's Google Classroom and start coding
- Once you are done, push your final code to your Github repo and modify this README to report on the work you have done

choice 1: it will draw triangle with random  size, orientation, location, color, border_size 30 times

choice 2: it will draw square with random  size, orientation, location, color, border_size 30 times

choice 3: it will draw pentagon with random  size, orientation, location, color, border_size 30 times

choice 4: it will draw either pentagon or square or triangle with random  size, orientation, location, color, border_size 30 times

choice 5: it will draw triangle with random size, orientation, location, color, border_size and 30 times and draw inside triangle with triangle 2 times

choice 6: it will draw square with random size, orientation, location, color, border_size and 30 times and draw inside square with square 2 times

choice 7: it will draw pentagon with random size, orientation, location, color, border_size and 30 times and draw inside pentagon with pentagon 2 times

choice 8: it will draw either pentagon or square or triangle with random  size, orientation, location, color, border_size 30 times and draw inside pentagon with 
pentagon 2 times, draw inside square with square 2 times and draw inside triangle with triangle 2 times

choice 9: it will draw either pentagon or square or triangle with random  size, orientation, location, color, border_size 30 times and draw inside pentagon with pentagon 2 times, draw inside square with square 2 times and draw inside triangle with triangle 2 times or just draw only triangle,square,pentagon with no draw inside
